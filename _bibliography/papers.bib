	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing childhood obesity is a global issue requiring potentially local solutions to ensure it does not continue into adulthood. We systematically identified potentially modifiable targets of obesity at the onset and end of puberty in Hong Kong, the most economically developed major Chinese city.
METHODS: We conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) and an epigenome-wide association study of obesity to systematically assess associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in Hong Kong's population-representative 'Children of 1997' birth cohort. Univariable linear regression was used to select exposures related to obesity at {\textasciitilde}11.5 years (BMI and obesity risk n ≤ 7119, WHR n = 5691) and {\textasciitilde}17.6 years (n = 3618) at Bonferroni-corrected significance, and multivariable regression to adjust for potential confounders followed by replicated multivariable regression (n = 308) and CpG by CpG analysis (n = 286) at {\textasciitilde}23 years. Findings were compared with evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.
RESULTS: At {\textasciitilde}11.5 and{\textasciitilde}17.6 years the EWAS identified 14 and 37 exposures associated with BMI, as well as 7 and 12 associated with WHR, respectively. Most exposures had directionally consistent associations at {\textasciitilde}23 years. Maternal second-hand smoking, maternal weight, and birth weight were consistently associated with obesity. Diet (including dairy intake and artificially sweetened beverages), physical activity, snoring, binge eating, and earlier puberty were positively associated with BMI at {\textasciitilde}17.6 years, while eating before sleep was inversely associated with BMI at {\textasciitilde}17.6 years. Findings for birth weight, dairy intake, and binge eating are consistent with available evidence from RCTs or MR studies. We found 17 CpGs related to BMI and 17 to WHR.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel insights into potentially modifiable factors associated with obesity at the outset and the end of puberty could, if causal, inform future interventions to improve population health in Hong Kong and similar Chinese settings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen plays an essential role in blood coagulation and inflammation. Circulating fibrinogen levels may be determined based on interindividual differences in DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and vice versa.
OBJECTIVES: To perform an EWAS to examine an association between blood DNA methylation levels and circulating fibrinogen levels to better understand its biological and pathophysiological actions.
METHODS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study of circulating fibrinogen levels in 18 037 White, Black, American Indian, and Hispanic participants, representing 14 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium. Circulating leukocyte DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array in 12 904 participants and using the EPIC array in 5133 participants. In each study, an epigenome-wide association study of fibrinogen was performed using linear mixed models adjusted for potential confounders. Study-specific results were combined using array-specific meta-analysis, followed by cross-replication of epigenome-wide significant associations. We compared models with and without CRP adjustment to examine the role of inflammation.
RESULTS: We identified 208 and 87 significant CpG sites associated with fibrinogen levels from the 450K (p {\textless} 1.03 × 10-7) and EPIC arrays (p {\textless} 5.78 × 10-8), respectively. There were 78 associations from the 450K array that replicated in the EPIC array and 26 vice versa. After accounting for overlapping sites, there were 83 replicated CpG sites located in 61 loci, of which only 4 have been previously reported for fibrinogen. The examples of genes located near these CpG sites were SOCS3 and AIM2, which are involved in inflammatory pathways. The associations of all 83 replicated CpG sites were attenuated after CRP adjustment, although many remained significant.
CONCLUSION: We identified 83 CpG sites associated with circulating fibrinogen levels. These associations are partially driven by inflammatory pathways shared by both fibrinogen and CRP.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Whether chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases causally affect the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) is controversial. We characterized the relationship between inflammatory diseases and risk of AD and explored the role of circulating inflammatory biomarkers in the relationships between inflammatory diseases and AD.
METHODS: We performed observational analyses for chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases and risk of AD using data from 2,047,513 participants identified in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Using data of a total of more than 1,100,000 individuals from 15 large-scale genome-wide association study data sets, we performed 2-sample Mendelian randomizations (MRs) to investigate the relationships between chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, circulating inflammatory biomarker levels, and risk of AD.
RESULTS: Cox regression models using CPRD data showed that the overall incidence of AD was higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; 95\% CI 1.15-1.19; p = 2.1 × 10-4), other inflammatory polyarthropathies and systematic connective tissue disorders (HR 1.13; 95\% CI 1.12-1.14; p = 8.6 × 10-5), psoriasis (HR 1.13; 95\% CI 1.10-1.16; p = 2.6 × 10-4), rheumatoid arthritis (HR 1.08; 95\% CI 1.06-1.11; p = 4.0 × 10-4), and multiple sclerosis (HR 1.06; 95\% CI 1.04-1.07; p = 2.8 × 10-4) compared with the age (±5 years) and sex-matched comparison groups free from all inflammatory diseases under investigation. Bidirectional MR analysis identified relationships between chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases and circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Particularly, circulating monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) level was suggestively associated with a higher risk of AD (odds ratio from inverse variance weighted [ORIVW] 1.23; 95\% CI 1.06-1.42; p IVW = 0.007) and lower risk of Crohn disease (ORIVW 0.73; 95\% CI -0.62 to 0.86; p IVW = 1.3 × 10-4). Colocalization supported a common causal single nucleotide polymorphism for MIG and Crohn disease (posterior probability = 0.74), but not AD (posterior probability = 0.03). Using a 2-sample MR approach, genetically predicted risks of inflammatory diseases were not associated with higher AD risk.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that the association between inflammatory diseases and risk of AD is unlikely to be causal and may be a result of confounding. In support, although inflammatory biomarkers showed evidence for causal associations with inflammatory diseases, evidence was weak that they affected both inflammatory disease and AD.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Mechanistic research suggests synergistic effects of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia pathologies on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting proteins relevant to shared mechanisms underlying CVD and dementia could also be used for the prevention of cognitive impairment. Methods: We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to investigate the causal relationships of 90 CVD-related proteins measured by the Olink CVD I panel with cognitive traits. Genetic instruments for circulatory protein concentrations were obtained using a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the SCALLOP consortium (N = 17,747) based on three sets of criteria: 1) protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); 2) cis-pQTL (pQTL within ±500 kb from the coding gene); and 3) brain-specific cis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) which accounts for coding gene expression based on GTEx8. Genetic associations of cognitive performance were obtained from GWAS for either: 1) general cognitive function constructed using Principal Component Analysis (N = 300,486); or, 2) g Factor constructed using genomic structural equation modelling (N = 11,263-331,679). Findings for candidate causal proteins were replicated using a separate protein GWAS in Icelanders (N = 35,559). Results: A higher concentration of genetically predicted circulatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) was nominally associated with better cognitive performance (p {\textless} 0.05) using different selection criteria for genetic instruments. Particularly, brain-specific cis-eQTL predicted MPO, which accounts for protein-coding gene expression in brain tissues, was associated with general cognitive function (βWald = 0.22, PWald = 2.4 × 10-4). The posterior probability for colocalization (PP.H4) of MPO pQTL with the g Factor was 0.577. Findings for MPO were replicated using the Icelandic GWAS. Although we did not find evidence for colocalization, we found that higher genetically predicted concentrations of cathepsin D and CD40 were associated with better cognitive performance and a higher genetically predicted concentration of CSF-1 was associated with poorer cognitive performance. Conclusion: We conclude that these proteins are involved in shared pathways between CVD and those for cognitive reserve or affecting cognitive decline, suggesting therapeutic targets able to reduce genetic risks conferred by cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Human brain development starts in the embryonic period. Maternal preconception nutrition and nutrient availability to the embryo may influence brain development at this critical period following conception and early cellular differentiation, thereby affecting offspring neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorder risk. However, studying this is challenging due to difficulties in characterizing preconception nutritional status and few studies have objective neurodevelopmental imaging measures in children. We investigated the associations of maternal preconception circulating blood nutrient-related biomarker mixtures ({\textasciitilde}15 weeks before conception) with child behavioural symptoms (Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), aged 3 years) within the Singapore Preconception Study of Long-Term Maternal and Child Outcomes (S-PRESTO) study. The CBCL preschool form evaluates child behaviours based on syndrome scales and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) oriented scales. These scales consist of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, anxiety problems, pervasive developmental problems, oppositional defiant, etc. We applied data-driven clustering and a method for modelling mixtures (Bayesian kernel machine regression, BKMR) to account for complex, non-linear dependencies between 67 biomarkers. We used effect decomposition analyses to explore the potential mediating role of neonatal (week 1) brain microstructure, specifically orientation dispersion indices (ODI) of 49 cortical and subcortical grey matter regions. We found that higher levels of a nutrient cluster including thiamine, thiamine monophosphate (TMP), pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxic acid, and pyridoxal were associated with a higher CBCL score for internalizing problems (posterior inclusion probability (PIP) = 0.768). Specifically, thiamine independently influenced CBCL (Conditional PIP = 0.775). Higher maternal preconception thiamine level was also associated with a lower right subthalamic nucleus ODI (P-value = 0.01) while a lower right subthalamic nucleus ODI was associated with higher CBCL scores for multiple domains (P-value {\textless} 0.05). One potential mechanism is the suboptimal metabolism of free thiamine to active vitamin B1, but additional follow-up and replication studies in other cohorts are needed.},

	doi = {10.1016/S2215-0366(22)00403-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of excess mortality in people with schizophrenia. Several factors are responsible, including lifestyle and metabolic effects of antipsychotics. However, variations in cardiac structure and function are seen in people with schizophrenia in the absence of cardiovascular disease risk factors and after accounting for lifestyle and medication. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether shared genetic causes contribute to these cardiac variations.
METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank and included White British or Irish individuals without diagnosed schizophrenia with variable polygenic risk scores for the condition. To test the association between polygenic risk score for schizophrenia and cardiac phenotype, we used principal component analysis and regression. Robust regression was then used to explore the association between the polygenic risk score for schizophrenia and individual cardiac phenotypes. We repeated analyses with fibro-inflammatory pathway-specific polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia. Last, we investigated genome-wide sharing of common variants between schizophrenia and cardiac phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression. The primary outcome was principal component regression.
FINDINGS: Of 33 353 individuals recruited, 32 279 participants had complete cardiac MRI data and were included in the analysis, of whom 16 625 (51·5\%) were female and 15 654 (48·5\%) were male. 1074 participants were excluded on the basis of incomplete cardiac MRI data (for all phenotypes). A model regressing polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia onto the first five cardiac principal components of the principal components analysis was significant (F=5·09; p=0·00012). Principal component 1 captured a pattern of increased cardiac volumes, increased absolute peak diastolic strain rates, and reduced ejection fractions; polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and principal component 1 were negatively associated (β=-0·01 [SE 0·003]; p=0·017). Similar to the principal component analysis results, for individual cardiac phenotypes, we observed negative associations between polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and indexed right ventricular end-systolic volume (β=-0·14 [0·04]; p=0·0013, pFDR=0·015), indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume (β=-0·17 [0·08]); p=0·025; pFDR=0·082), and absolute longitudinal peak diastolic strain rates (β=-0·01 [0·003]; p=0·0024, pFDR=0·015), and a positive association between polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and right ventricular ejection fraction (β=0·09 [0·03]; p=0·0041, pFDR=0·015). Models examining the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-specific and acute inflammation-specific polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia found significant associations with the first five principal components (F=2·62, p=0·022; F=2·54, p=0·026). Using linkage disequilibrium score regression, we observed genetic overlap with schizophrenia for right ventricular end-systolic volume and right ventricular ejection fraction (p=0·0090, p=0·0077).
INTERPRETATION: High polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia are associated with decreased cardiac volumes, increased ejection fractions, and decreased absolute peak diastolic strain rates. TGF-β and inflammatory pathways might be implicated, and there is evidence of genetic overlap for some cardiac phenotypes. Reduced absolute peak diastolic strain rates indicate increased myocardial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction, which increases risk of cardiac disease. Thus, genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with cardiac structural changes that can worsen cardiac outcomes. Further work is required to determine whether these associations are specific to schizophrenia or are also seen in other psychiatric conditions.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic loci associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms by which they confer risk are largely unknown. We conducted a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) of AD-associated loci from GWASs using untargeted metabolic profiling (metabolomics) by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We identified an association of lactosylceramides (LacCer) with AD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCA7 (P = 5.0 × 10-5 to 1.3 × 10-44). We showed that plasma LacCer concentrations are associated with cognitive performance and genetically modified levels of LacCer are associated with AD risk. We then showed that concentrations of sphingomyelins, ceramides, and hexosylceramides were altered in brain tissue from Abca7 knockout mice, compared with wild type (WT) (P = 0.049-1.4 × 10-5), but not in a mouse model of amyloidosis. Furthermore, activation of microglia increases intracellular concentrations of hexosylceramides in part through induction in the expression of sphingosine kinase, an enzyme with a high control coefficient for sphingolipid and ceramide synthesis. Our work suggests that the risk for AD arising from functional variations in ABCA7 is mediated at least in part through ceramides. Modulation of their metabolism or downstream signaling may offer new therapeutic opportunities for AD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and experimental evidence has linked chronic inflammation to cancer aetiology. It is unclear whether associations for specific inflammatory biomarkers are causal or due to bias. In order to examine whether altered genetically predicted concentration of circulating cytokines are associated with cancer development, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis.
METHODS: Up to 31,112 individuals of European descent were included in genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of 47 circulating cytokines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with the cytokines, located in or close to their coding gene (cis), were used as instrumental variables. Inverse-variance weighted MR was used as the primary analysis, and the MR assumptions were evaluated in sensitivity and colocalization analyses and a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Corresponding germline GWAS summary data for five cancer outcomes (breast, endometrial, lung, ovarian, and prostate), and their subtypes were selected from the largest cancer-specific GWASs available (cases ranging from 12,906 for endometrial to 133,384 for breast cancer).
RESULTS: There was evidence of inverse associations of macrophage migration inhibitory factor with breast cancer (OR per SD = 0.88, 95\% CI 0.83 to 0.94), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist with endometrial cancer (0.86, 0.80 to 0.93), interleukin-18 with lung cancer (0.87, 0.81 to 0.93), and beta-chemokine-RANTES with ovarian cancer (0.70, 0.57 to 0.85) and positive associations of monokine induced by gamma interferon with endometrial cancer (3.73, 1.86 to 7.47) and cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine with lung cancer (1.51, 1.22 to 1.87). These associations were similar in sensitivity analyses and supported in colocalization analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds to current knowledge on the role of specific inflammatory biomarker pathways in cancer aetiology. Further validation is needed to assess the potential of these cytokines as pharmacological or lifestyle targets for cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {Aortic dimensions and distensibility are key risk factors for aortic aneurysms and dissections, as well as for other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. We present genome-wide associations of ascending and descending aortic distensibility and area derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of up to 32,590 Caucasian individuals in UK Biobank. We identify 102 loci (including 27 novel associations) tagging genes related to cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix production, smooth muscle cell contraction and heritable aortic diseases. Functional analyses highlight four signalling pathways associated with aortic distensibility (TGF-β, IGF, VEGF and PDGF). We identify distinct sex-specific associations with aortic traits. We develop co-expression networks associated with aortic traits and apply phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR-PheWAS), generating evidence for a causal role for aortic distensibility in development of aortic aneurysms. Multivariable MR suggests a causal relationship between aortic distensibility and cerebral white matter hyperintensities, mechanistically linking aortic traits and brain small vessel disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated molecular biomarkers of specific executive function (EF) skills in children. We aimed to characterise the prospective associations between metabolome and multiple domains of EF using a bidirectional design.
METHODS: This study was conducted within a longitudinal birth cohort, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO). Circulating levels of 165 metabolites were quantified using a nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics platform (n = 457 (∼6yrs) and n = 524 (∼8yrs)). Parent-reported EF was available for 495 children (∼7yrs). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the metabolite-EF relationships. We examined the role of body composition, dietary factors, and genetics in the metabolite-EF associations.
FINDINGS: Higher leucine level (∼6yrs) was associated with poorer EF (∼7yrs, Initiate (P = 0.003) and Working Memory (P = 0.004)). EF (∼7yrs) was not associated with leucine (∼8yrs). Importantly, we found weak evidence for associations of dietary factors (∼5yrs) with leucine (∼6yrs) and EF (∼7yrs). Each copy of C allele in rs1260326 (a leucine-related polymorphism) was associated with higher leucine level and poorer Initiate and Working Memory (P {\textless} 0.05). Amongst those with less strongly genetically influenced leucine, inverse association between leucine and cognitive regulation were weaker among those with higher BMI.
INTERPRETATION: The observed association between higher leucine level and poorer EF may be determined by genetics and may not be easily amenable to dietary interventions. Further research is needed for validation and to understand mechanisms.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has aroused a range of negative effects. Such considerable influence can be greater in vulnerable populations including pregnant women. This study aimed to assess the presence of prenatal depression (PND, as an important risk factor of postpartum depression) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to characterize infection-induced preventive behaviors and psychological responses in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak.
METHODS: Based on a population-based sample of pregnant women from all regions in China, presence of probable PND and suspected PTSD were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (≥13) and the PTSD Checklist (≥14), respectively. A web-based questionnaire was used to assess psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19.
RESULTS: Among a total of 1908 questionnaires returned, 1901 women provided valid data (mean [SD] age, 28.9 [4.7] years). High prevalence of probable PND (34\%) and suspected PTSD (40\%) among pregnant women was observed. Those with suspected PTSD presented six times higher risk of probable PND than the non-suspected (OR=7.83, 95\% CI: 6.29-9.75; p{\textless}0.001). Most women (91\%-96\%) reported anxiousness about infection of themselves and the members within their social network. Lack of security and loss of freedom were reported in approximately two-thirds of pregnant women. More frequent preventive behaviors, including handwashing, use of facemasks, and staying at home, were undertaken in more than 80\% of the sample. Anxiousness of miscarriage and preterm birth were prevalent ({\textgreater}75\%).
CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of PND and PTSD and high levels of anxiety suggest profound impacts of the present outbreak on mental health. This calls for special attention and support for vulnerable populations. Mental health care should become part of public health measures during the present outbreak and should continue to be intensified to empower the health system for post-outbreak periods.},

	abstract = {Coffee and tea are extensively consumed beverages worldwide which have received considerable attention regarding health. Intake of these beverages is consistently linked to, among others, reduced risk of diabetes and liver diseases; however, the mechanisms of action remain elusive. Epigenetics is suggested as a mechanism mediating the effects of dietary and lifestyle factors on disease onset. Here we report the results from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) on coffee and tea consumption in 15,789 participants of European and African-American ancestries from 15 cohorts. EWAS meta-analysis of coffee consumption reveals 11 CpGs surpassing the epigenome-wide significance threshold (P-value {\textless}1.1×10-7), which annotated to the AHRR, F2RL3, FLJ43663, HDAC4, GFI1 and PHGDH genes. Among them, cg14476101 is significantly associated with expression of the PHGDH and risk of fatty liver disease. Knockdown of PHGDH expression in liver cells shows a correlation with expression levels of genes associated with circulating lipids, suggesting a role of PHGDH in hepatic-lipid metabolism. EWAS meta-analysis on tea consumption reveals no significant association, only two CpGs annotated to CACNA1A and PRDM16 genes show suggestive association (P-value {\textless}5.0×10-6). These findings indicate that coffee-associated changes in DNA methylation levels may explain the mechanism of action of coffee consumption in conferring risk of diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the causal relationships between sleep, major depressive disorder (MDD), and Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: We conducted bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. Genetic associations were obtained from the largest genome-wide association studies currently available in UK Biobank (n = 446,118), Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n = 18,759), and International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (n = 63,926). We used the inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization method to estimate causal effects and weighted median and Mendelian randomization-Egger for sensitivity analyses to test for pleiotropic effects.
RESULTS: We found that higher risk of AD was significantly associated with being a "morning person" (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, p = 0.001), shorter sleep duration (self-reported: β = -0.006, p = 1.9 × 10-4; accelerometer based: β = -0.015, p = 6.9 × 10-5), less likely to report long sleep (β = -0.003, p = 7.3 × 10-7), earlier timing of the least active 5 hours (β = -0.024, p = 1.7 × 10-13), and a smaller number of sleep episodes (β = -0.025, p = 5.7 × 10-14) after adjustment for multiple comparisons. We also found that higher risk of AD was associated with lower risk of insomnia (OR 0.99, p = 7 × 10-13). However, we did not find evidence that these abnormal sleep patterns were causally related to AD or for a significant causal relationship between MDD and risk of AD.
CONCLUSION: We found that AD may causally influence sleep patterns. However, we did not find evidence supporting a causal role of disturbed sleep patterns for AD or evidence for a causal relationship between MDD and AD.},

We extended this analysis with a phenome-wide association study, in which we tested for correlations of a wide range of non-imaging phenotypes of the participants with imaging phenotypes. We further explored the associations of imaging phenotypes with early-life factors, mental health and cognitive function using both observational analysis and Mendelian randomization.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50\% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.
METHODS: We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.
FINDINGS: Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million.
INTERPRETATION: Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of early exposure to air pollution with lung function at {\textasciitilde}17.5 years in a non-western developed setting with more concentrated air pollutants.
METHODS: We examined the associations of exposure to particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter of {\textless}10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) in standard deviations (SD)) at different early life stages with lung function (indicated by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced expiratory flow at 25\%-75\% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25\%-75\%)) in SD at {\textasciitilde}17.5 years, personal history of wheezing and asthma in the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese birth cohort "Children of 1997"(n = 2942).
RESULTS: Higher in utero and infancy and toddlerhood NO2 were associated with lower FEV1 (-0.022, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.029 to -0.015 and - 0.026, 95\% CI -0.033 to -0.019), FEV1/FVC (-0.035, 95\% CI -0.050 to -0.021 and -0.052, 95\% CI -0.066 to -0.038) and FEF25\%-75\% (-0.031, 95\% CI -0.040 to -0.022 and -0.043, 95\% CI -0.051 to -0.035). A similar association was observed for NO. Weak associations of NO2 and NO with FVC were observed (-0.011, 95\% CI -0.018 to -0.003 and -0.010, 95\% CI -0.020 to -0.001). NOx was associated with higher risk of wheezing (1.08, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14) but not asthma (1.02, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.11). SO2 and PM10 were not clearly associated with lung function, wheezing or asthma.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that early exposure to air pollution from NO2 may have long-term effects on lung function, which could affect respiratory health throughout life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Child overweight and obesity have increased substantially in many countries. Physical and psychological effects of childhood obesity endure throughout adulthood. Much attention has been paid to energy intake and expenditure in childhood adiposity, but less to environmental factors, such as outdoor air quality. Here we assessed prospectively the association of exposure to air pollution with body mass index (BMI) in late childhood and early adolescence.
METHODS: We assessed the association of air pollutants (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 µm or less (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) at different growth phases (in utero, in infancy, and in childhood) with BMI at {\textasciitilde}9, {\textasciitilde}11, {\textasciitilde}13, and {\textasciitilde}15 years in a population-representative birth cohort from Hong Kong, "Children of 1997." We used partial least square regression to account for colinearity between pollutants and exposure periods. We also assessed whether associations varied by sex from model fit.
RESULTS: Associations were sex-specific based on better model fit when including sex interaction terms. Among boys, higher SO2 in utero was associated with lower BMI at {\textasciitilde}13 and {\textasciitilde}15 years, higher SO2 in childhood with lower BMI at {\textasciitilde}15 years, and higher NO2 in childhood with higher BMI at {\textasciitilde}9, {\textasciitilde}13, and {\textasciitilde}15 years using a multi-pollutant model.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings of air pollutant- and sex-specific associations with adiposity should give impetus to the investigation of their physiological effects, possibly operating as endocrine disruptors or via mitochondria, so as to protect the next generation of boys.},

	abstract = {Obesity is associated with higher cardio-metabolic risk even in childhood and adolescence; whether this association is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms remains unclear. We examined the extent to which mid-childhood body mass index (BMI) z-score (median age 7.7 years) was associated with cardio-metabolic risk score in early adolescence (median age 12.9 years) via mid-childhood DNA methylation among 265 children in the Project Viva. We measured DNA methylation in leukocytes using the Infinium Human Methylation450K BeadChip. We assessed mediation CpG-by-CpG using epigenome-wide association analyses, high-dimensional mediation analysis, and natural effect models. We observed mediation by mid-childhood DNA methylation at 6 CpGs for the association between mid-childhood BMI z-score and cardio-metabolic risk score in early adolescence in the high-dimensional mediation analysis (accounting for 10\% of the total effect) and in the natural effect model (β = 0.04, P = 3.2e-2, accounting for 13\% of the total effect). The natural direct effect of BMI z-score on cardio-metabolic risk score was still evident (β = 0.27, P = 1.1e-25). We also observed mediation by mid-childhood DNA methylation at 5 CpGs that was in the opposite direction from the total effect (natural effect model: β = -0.04, P = 2.0e-2). Mediation in different directions implies a complex role of DNA methylation in the association between BMI and cardio-metabolic risk and needs further investigation. Future studies with larger sample size and greater variability in cardio-metabolic risk will further help elucidate the role of DNA methylation for cardio-metabolic risk.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
