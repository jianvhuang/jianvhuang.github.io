Hi, I am Jian Huang. I am a public health researcher and molecular epidemiologist. I obtained my Master's degree in Public Health (MPH) and PhD in epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, with a one-year research visit at Columbia University focusing on molecular epidemiology. After my PhD, I joined Imperial College London to work on research projects aiming to enhance our understanding of lifestyle and molecular risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Currently, I am a Research Fellow at Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).

My research interest lies primarily in understanding the causal relationship of environmental and lifestyle factors with human health, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship. Particularly, I am interested in cardiometabolic health, child neurodevelopment, later-life neurodegeneration, and multi-omics (e.g., genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics). Here, I will share the updates on my research work and ongoing projects.
