I am a public health researcher and molecular epidemiologist. I obtained my Master's degree in Public Health (MPH) and PhD in epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, with a one-year research visit at Columbia University focusing on molecular epidemiology. After my PhD, I joined Imperial College London to work on research projects aiming to enhance our understanding of lifestyle and molecular risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Currently, I am a Senior Scientist at the Institute for Human Development and Potential, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR IHDP, formerly known as Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS)).

My research interest lies primarily in unravelling the causal relationship of environmental and lifestyle factors with human health, and the mechanisms underlying this relationship. My experiences encompass a broad spectrum of epidemiological research, ranging from early development to ageing. I have navigated diverse omics data and employed advanced statistical methods in my research work based on multiple birth cohorts and population-based cohorts. 

Built upon these multifaceted experiences, my current research focuses on the mechanisms connecting cardiometabolic and neurocognitive health across life and generations. I investigate this through two distinct lenses: first, the biological mechanisms (e.g., genetic risk and multi-omics), and second, the profound influence of social and behavioural determinants. I will share updates on my research work and ongoing projects here.
